# Verse 1
## Mūla
So long as there are opportunities for hopes/spaces, the Lotus Hand reigns supreme—he whose nature incomparable bliss, who is an abode of riches, who is without any abode, whose consorts are the incomparable ten goddesses, who is accompanied by his consort, who brings about the attainment of bliss that has benefit for the three worlds, and who is without degeneration.

## Commentary
Concerning the verse beginning '... incomparable', the syntax (*sambandha*) is as follows: 'The Lotus Hand', [a *vyadhikaraṇabahuvrīhi*] meaning he who has a lotus (*kamala* = *padma*) in hand, i.e. the blessed Avalokiteśvara, reigns supreme (√*ji*). How is he distinguished? He is called one whose nature (*rūpa* = *svabhāva*) is none other than bliss that is incomparable (*anupama*), i.e. it is without a point of comparison (*upamā*) since there is nothing else that has the qualities of extreme excellence (*atipraṇīta*), greatness (*mahattva*), and steadiness (*sthāyitva*) so long as *saṃsāra* remains. How else is he distinguished? 'Riches' (*śrī*) are the requisites (*sambhāra*) of merit and knowledge. He is called one who is an abode (*nivāsa*) or locus (*āśraya*) of those because, as the Dharmakāya, he is all pervasive.

How else is he distinguished? He is one who has as his attendants (*paricāraka*) consorts (*vidyā*) who are the ten goddesses—namely, the ten beginning with Rūpavajrā and ending with Tārā. They are incomparable (*nirupama*), i.e. they surpass all points of comparison in that they have [qualities] beginning with supreme beauty (*rūpa*) and youth (*yauvana*), the *rasa*s of amorousness and so forth, and great compassion. He is present with his [own personal] consort who resembles him (*svābhā*) and thus is said to be 'accompanied by his consort' (*savidya*). He is called ['one who brings about the attainment of bliss that has benefit for the three worlds' (*tribhuvanahitasaukhyaprāptikāra*)]: he is one of whom there is the creation (*kāra* = *karaṇa*) of the attainment (*prāpti*) or manifestation (*sākṣātkriyā*) of bliss (*sukha*), i.e. the temporarily beneficial being a universal monarch and the like, which [itself] has benefit (*hita*), i.e. the eventually beneficial being a buddha and the like, for the three worlds (*tribhuvana*), i.e. for the beings (*jana*) who reside (*vartin*) in the three worlds. He is 'who is without degeneration' (*avikāra*) because he lack the degeneration (*vikāra*), i.e. being otherwise (*anyathātva*), insofar as, by lacking the quality of complete *nirvāṇa*, his nature is that of non-abiding *nirvāṇa*. The Blessed One who is in these ways distinguished reigns supreme.

For how long? Addressing this, the author says 'so long as there are opportunities for hopes/spaces (*āśā*)'. Spaces (*āśā*) are the spaces of the ten directions. Alternatively, hopes (*āśā*) are the longings of all beings for enjoyment in the world (*bhavabhogatṛṣṇa*). Their opportunities (*vikāśa* = *avakāśa*) are their functioning (*pravarta*), which is as much as to say their coming into existence (*prādurbhāva*). So long as there are [such] opportunities, for that long the Blessed One reigns supreme, which is to say that he is superior compared to all [gods] such as Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, and Brahmā.

[^1]: The compound also appears in the *Madhyantavibhāgaṭīkā* and the ‘*Yoga Lehrbuch*'

Here, by saying that he is one 'whose nature incomparable bliss', his perfection (*saṃpat*) of his personal aims is expressed. By saying that he is 'an abode of riches', the means to that [perfection is expressed], because the word 'riches' (*śrī*) refers to the requisites of merit and wisdom. By saying that he is one 'who brings about the attainment of bliss that has benefit for the three worlds', the perfection of the aims of others is taught. By saying that he is one 'whose consorts are the incomparable ten goddesses' and 'who is accompanied by his consort', the means to that [perfection is taught], because one is unable to bring about the perfection of the aims of others without bodies that are accompanied by those kind of goddesses and endowed with the thirty two major signs and eighty minor marks.

# Verse 2
## Mūla
Employing seven divisions thronging with the teachings of various [teachers], I undertake the present effort to bring about clear understanding to those who indeed do not know the nature, devoid of [expression through] clear words, of the beautiful fourth consecration belonging to the glorious Way of Mantra.

## Commentary
The words 'glorious Way of Mantra', although they can express the common *yogatantra*s, [here] refer to the glorious *[Guhya]samāja*, since the meaning/content of the fourth [initiation] does not appear elsewhere. The rest one can easily understand. \[I undertake the present effort] by employing seven divisions (*bheda* = *prakāra*) thronging (*saṃkula* = *vyākula*) with many (*gaṇa*) teachings of various teachers—i.e., they bring together a collection (*rāśi*) of teachings by teachers of the past, present, and future. \[I do so] `to bring about clear understanding', i.e. for the sake of easily (*sukhena*) comprehending clearly.

# Verse 3
## Mūla
All (*nikhila*) non-Buddhist philosophers (*tīrthya*) have completely mistaken (*sambhrānta*) ideas (*bodha*) regarding the realisation of the nature (*rūpa*) of reality and the goal. People say that say that the best among them are the Vedāntins, supposedly (*kila*) knowers of reality.

## Commentary
Non-Buddhist philosophers are [here] called those whose ideas (*bodha*), i.e. particular insights, are completely mistaken (*sambhrānta* = *vibhrānta*).
Absolutely all of the non-Buddhist philosophers have their mind's eyes injured by the eye diesease (*timira*) of grasping to the self (*ātman*) and its belongings (*ātmīya*).
Thinking 'This is reality' and 'This is the goal,' they are confused (*bhrānta*) with respect to realisation (*vitti* = *pratīti*) of nature (*svarūpa*) of reality and the goal.
The remainder is easy to understand.

\[Objection:] But insofar as reality and the goal are both to be adopted (*upādeya*), reality and the goal have the same nature.
So how are they taught (*nirdeśa*) separately (*bhedena*)?
This is not true.
For, even though it is to be adopted, reality pervades of the entirety (saṃdoha) of all appearances, be they pleasant, painful, neutral, or otherwise. 
And the goal, is the fruit, characterised by one's wish, by casting off what is not desired. 
Even though it is to be adopted, it is surely by means of exclusion of what is not the goal that it is desired as to be accomplished by all sentient beings.
Thus there is no fault.
