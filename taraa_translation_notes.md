## Commentary
Concerning the verse beginning '... incomparable', the syntax (*sambandha*) is as follows: 'The Lotus Hand', [a \emph{vyadhikaraṇabahuvrīhi}] meaning he who has a lotus (*kamala* = *padma*) in hand, i.e.\ the blessed Avalokiteśvara, reigns supreme. How is he distinguished? He is called one whose nature (*rūpa* = *svabhāva*) is none other than bliss that is incomprabable, i.t.\ it is without a point of comparison (*upamā*) since there is nothing else that has the qualities of extreme excellence (*atipraṇīta*), greatness (*mahattva*), and steadiness (*sthāyitva*) so long as *saṃsāra* remains. How else is he distinguished? 'Riches' are the requisites (*sambhāra*) of merit and knowledge. He is called one who is an abode (*nivāsa*) or locus (*āśraya*) of those because, as the Dharmakāya, he is all pervasive.

How else is he distinguished? He is one who has as his attendants (*paricāraka*) consorts (*vidyā*) who are the ten goddesses—namely, the ten beginning with Rūpavajrā and ending with Tārā. They are incomparable (*nirupama*), i.e.,\ they surpass all points of comparison in that they have [qualities] beginning with supreme beauty (*rūpa*) and youth (*yauvana*), the flavours of amorousness and so forth, and compassion. He is present with his [own personal] consort who resembles him (*svābhā*) and thus is said to be 'accompanied by his consort' (*savidya*). He is called ['one who brings about the attainment of bliss that has benefit for the three worlds']: he is one of whom there is the creation (*kāra* = *karaṇa*) of the attainment (*prāpti*) or manifestation (*sākṣātkriyā*) of bliss (*sukha*), i.e. the temporarily beneficial being a universal monarch and the like, which [itself] has benefit, i.e. the eventually beneficial being a buddha and the like, for the three worlds, i.e. for the beings who reside in the three worlds. He is 'who is without degeneration' because he lack the degeneration (*vikāra*), i.e.\ being otherwise (*anyathātva*), insofar as, by lacking the quality of complete \emph{nirvāṇa}, his nature is that of non-abiding \emph{nirvāṇa}. The Blessed One who is in these ways distinguished reigns supreme.

For how long? Addressing this, the author says 'So long as there are opportunities for hopes/spaces'. Spaces (*āśā*) are the spaces of the ten directions. Alternatively, hopes (*āśā*) are the longings of all beings for enjoyment in the world. Their opportunities (*vikāśa* = *avakāśa*) are their functioning (*pravarta*), which is as much as to say their coming into existence (*prādurbhāva*). So long as there are [such] opportunities, for that long the Blessed One reigns supreme, which is to say that he is superior to all [gods] such as Śiva, Kṛṣṇa, and Brahmā.

Here, by saying he is one 'whose nature incomparable bliss', his perfection of his personal aims is expressed. By saying he is 'an abode of riches', the means to that [perfection is expressed], because the word 'riches' (*śrī*) expresses the requisites of merit and wisdom. By saying he is one 'who brings about the attainment of bliss that has benefit for the three worlds', the perfection of the aims of others is taught. By saying he is one 'whose consorts are the incomparable ten goddesses' and 'who is accompanied by his consort', the means to that [perfection is taught], because one is unable to bring about the perfection of the aims of others without bodies that are accompanied by those kind of goddesses and endowed with the thirty two major signs and eighty minor marks.
